## Introduction

---

We're a venture studio that partners with tenacious founders to build hyper-local startups from the ground up.

Every studio is a little different. Our model is to come up with a new idea every month, build an MVP and let users
decide if they love that idea or not.

We build [A LOT OF NEW THINGS](https://writing.neighborhoodstudios.com). Every time we come up with the next best idea,
we're going through a lot of the same motions to get it off the ground.

So we decided to build an opinionated framework to help us build new things faster. Introducing SFA ðŸš€!
